# ML-Projekt-WineQuality
This small project was conducted as part of a Machine Learning course at the university. The objective was to utilize machine learning techniques to determine the quality of wine.

In order to gain a better understanding of the features, the dataset was initially visualized. This step involved creating visual representations of the data points, such as scatter plots or histograms, to explore their distribution, identify potential outliers, and observe possible correlations between the different features.
